## 🤖 Smart Asset Selection

### When Logo is the Hero (Main Element)
**Use 2-color versions** for maximum brand recognition:
- Homepage headers, business cards, presentation title slides
- Main branding elements where logo is the focus

### When Logo is Supporting Element  
**Default to 1-color neutral** for professional appearance:
- Footers, watermarks, corner branding
- Designs with lots of color (neutral won't compete)

**Consider green version** for minimal designs:
- Black and white ads where logo needs to stand out
- Very neutral designs where brand color adds impact

## 📐 Brand Guidelines

- **Clear space**: Keep space equal to 1/4 the height of the 'Q' around logo
- **Minimum size**: 70px height for digital applications
- **Primary green**: #229529 (PMS 347)
