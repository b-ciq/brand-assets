# ðŸŽ¯ Easy Installation Guide

Great news! We can make installation **much easier** for your team.

## **Current Reality (Technical Users):**

Right now, yes - users need to:
1. Install FastMCP
2. Clone the repo  
3. Run the server locally
4. Configure Claude Desktop

## **Better Options for Distribution:**

### **Option 1: Pip Package (Recommended for CIQ)**
```bash
# Users would just run:
pip install ciq-brand-assets
ciq-brand-assets

# Then configure Claude Desktop - done!
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **One command install** for technical users
- âœ… **Version management** (updates via `pip install --upgrade`)
- âœ… **Professional** - standard Python distribution
- âœ… **Internal PyPI** - you could host privately

### **Option 2: Docker Container**
```bash
# Users run:
docker run -p 3000:3000 ciq/brand-assets-server

# No Python/FastMCP installation needed
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **Zero dependencies** - just Docker
- âœ… **Consistent environment** - works everywhere
- âœ… **Easy deployment** - could run on company server

### **Option 3: Standalone Executable**
```bash
# Download and run:
./ciq-brand-assets-server.exe  # Windows
./ciq-brand-assets-server      # Mac/Linux

# No installation needed at all
```

**Benefits:**  
- âœ… **Non-technical friendly** - just download and run
- âœ… **No dependencies** - completely self-contained
- âœ… **Simple distribution** - email the file

## **Who Is Your Target Audience?**

### **Technical Team (Developers, DevOps):**
- **Pip package** works great
- They're comfortable with `pip install` and command line

### **Marketing/Design Team:**
- **Standalone executable** is much better
- Download file â†’ double-click â†’ works

### **Mixed Team:**
- **Docker container** - IT can set up once, everyone uses

---

## **My Recommendation for CIQ:**

### **Phase 1: Pip Package (Now)**
Easy to implement, works great for technical users:

```bash
# Internal team installs with:
pip install git+https://github.com/b-ciq/brand-assets.git
ciq-brand-assets

# Takes 30 seconds, very professional
```

### **Phase 2: Standalone Executable (Later)**
For broader company adoption:
- Marketing team gets simple .exe file
- IT distributes via normal software channels
- No technical knowledge required

## **Implementation:**

I already started the pip package structure for you! With the `pyproject.toml` file, your repo is almost ready to be pip-installable.

**Want me to finish the pip package setup?** It would make installation much simpler for your team.

**Or would you prefer to explore Docker/executable options first?**

The pip approach is probably 2-3 hours of work and would make distribution **much** easier immediately.
